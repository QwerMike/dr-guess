</p>

*Snippet Sharing is a service for sharing code/text snippets. It allows you to paste a text snippet, and then you can share the link to it with somebody.*

## Info
You can paste a text snippet, and then you will get two links.  
First link allows you to modify and delete the snippet.  
The second link grants only read-only access.

## Links
- [Functional specifications][1]
- [Architecture][2]
- [SOLID compliant][3]

## Resiliency
There are four endpoints in the API, conforming to basic CRUD operations.
Each snippet has a value, title, author and type.
Snippets can be viewed with readonly or edit rights.
All endpoints have their timeout set to sixty seconds.
All errors are handled properly on the client side.

|    Endpoint    |                       Resiliency                     |
| -------------- |:----------------------------------------------------:|
| createSnippet  | error if no value is in the request body             |
| getSnippet     | error if no snippet with that id                     |
| updateSnippet  | error if no snippet with edit permission by that id  |
| deleteSnippet  | error if no snippet with edit permission by that id  |

## Security
The service is completely anonymous, no user data is stored, hence, there cannot be any breaches.
When creating a snippet the author gets two links - one with edit permission 
and one with view only permission.
Links are generated by Firebase and cannot be bruteforced.

## Monitoring
Monitoring results can be found [here][(https://github.com/QwerMike/dr-guess/blob/master/docs/monitoring).
Firebase has built-in tools for basic monitoring of:
- Crashes;
- Connections (realtime & overall history);
- Storage usage;
- Performance
  * App startup metrics;
  * Network response metrics;
  * Database load.
- App health;
- Error groups;
- Logs.

They provide metrics for:
- Database;
- Storage;
- Hosting;
- Cloud Functions.

## Telemetry
Google Analytics.

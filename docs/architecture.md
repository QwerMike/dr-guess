# Architecture
The application is planned to be **serverless**.  
We are going to use [Firebase][1] platform for backend - specifically [Cloud Functions][2] and [Realtime Database][3].  
And the frontend is going to be single-page application (perhaps pure Javascript or using some framework, e.g., [Inferno][4] or [Mithril][5]).
